Changes:
- SoftSerial1 RX enabled on "Current" board pin, TX on LED pin
- Disabled support for PPM on UART RX2
- RSSI Pin used for VBAT pin (range s 0...3.3, se additional voltage divider!). It is used when FC is powerred from Boost DC-DC converter.
- Servo3 remapped as PINIO1


Connections: 
UART1: GPS
UART2: Mavlink Bidir
SoftSerial1: TX: Led pin, RX: CurrentPin - MSP DisplayPort 
VBat sensor: Board Pin RSSI
Servo3: Light enable PINIO
