Changes:
- SoftSerial1 RX enabled on "Current" board pin
- Disabled support for PPM on UART RX2
- Softserial2 enabled on LED pin (RX/TX on same pin)
- RSSI Pin used for VBAT pin (range s 0...3.3, se additional voltage divider!). It is used when FC is powerred from Boost DC-DC converter.
- Servo3 remapped as PINIO1


Connections: 
UART1: Booard Pin RX1, Board Pin TX1 -> GPS
UART2: Board Pin RX2 -> SBUS
SoftSerial1: Board Pin TX2/Board Pin Current -> TX/RX for Mavlink 
SoftSerial2: Board Pin LED/LED -> SmartAudio 
VBat sensor: Board Pin RSSI
Servo3: Light enable PINIO
